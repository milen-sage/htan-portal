# HTAN Data Portal
This repo contains the code for the [Human Tumor Atlas Network Data Portal](https://data.humantumoratlas.org/)

## Framework
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Backend
All data is coming from [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/). We have a Python script that generates a JSON file that contains all the metadata. There is currently no backend, it's a fully static site i.e. all filtering happens on the frontend.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
